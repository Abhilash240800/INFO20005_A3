What a great package, all in all.\nA quick question. After I ordered it, I thought that I should have ordered the hard shell case for the trip over. It arrived in good shape, however, for the long haul, I want to get the BMG hard shell case. Can I exchange? How much? Many thanks again, you offered great, fast, service.\nBackstory: I got a discount coupon from one of the big online stores, so I went through all the guitar offerings. There were over 2,000 guitars and about halfway through them, came across the BMG. Immediately ordered it. Then a week later, they canceled the order citing out of stock. Had been so excited about getting one and prior to this, didn't know they existed. So I located you all and ordered it"

The Wilkinson and Grover hardware are top drawer, and the pickups speak for themselves. Comfortable neck shape and stays in tune. All in all an easy guitar to play. But what stands out for me is the fun in playing this guitar due to the wide variety of sounds available through the separate on/off and phase pickup switches. I’m really enjoying my new Red Special!"

Plus, if i couldn't pay, they would have sent the guitar back.\nAnyway, apart from this little inconvenience, I am very very happy!!\nI suggest writing about the customs duty thing on the website, if that's possible, it would be helpful!"

        "story": "A meticulously constructed, devastatingly accurate, hand-crafted, modern replica one of rock 'n' roll's most storied instruments, the development of the BMG Super, a collaboration between Dr. Brian May, Pete Malandrone and House Music MD Barry Moorhouse, has has been informed by invaluable input from an all-star, globe-spanning team of Red Special-ists, including Australian RS guru Greg Fryer, East Anglian luthier Andrew Guyton, Japanese master craftsman Kazutaka Ijuin and British electronics wizard Aaron Armstrong.  Adding to the international flavour, the Super is now hand-crafted in the Czech Republic by the New Bohemia Electric Corp. (taking over from the initial 2008 - 2010 production by Japan's Kz GuitarWorks). World renowned for their exceptional build quality and innovation, New Bohemia's output also includes a range of superb electric guitars, basses and concert string instruments for Manson, Warwick, Stuart Spector and Ned Steinberger's NS Design marque. The Super is designed to bridge the gap between BMG's own, competitively priced BMG Special model and Andrew Guyton's marvellous (and reassuringly expensive) hand-built instruments and is - without question - the most authentic, officially sanctioned Red Special replica in its price range. Equally importantly, as a modern update to Brian May and his father Harold's unique 50-year old innovations, the Super stands proudly on its own merits as an astonishingly versatile, exquisitely engineered, professional grade instrument.",
        "details": {
            "Construction": "With the barest minimum of compromise, every effort has been made to re-imagine the Red Special, hence the Super conforms to the original's dimensions and technical appointments in almost every regard - body and headstock dimensions, neck profile, fingerboard radius, binding, scratchplate shapes, pickup surrounds, tremolo and electronics are all faithfully accurate. Fifty years on, there are inevitably some differences in materials... instead of oak and blackboard, the body is constructed from quartersawn Mahogany with a book-matched, antique-cherry stained Mahogany top, resulting in some minor modifications to the internal acoustic chambering and control cavity. In addition, The Super benefits from a much stronger, glued-in neck join, rather than single bolt-on construction and, in favour of black painted oak, features a wonderfully smooth 24 fret ebony fingerboard. Of course, benefiting from the scientific level of study carried out by Greg Fryer on the Red Special and from knowledge gained by Andrew Guyton during his restoration work on the original, all of The Super's alternative appointments and modifications have been made true to the spirit and character of the \"Old Lady\".",
            "BMG® Super Pickups": "Developed and produced in the UK exclusively for the BMG Super project by pickup specialist Aaron Armstrong, these hand-wound recreations of the Adeson-spec Tri-Sonic pickups built between 1960 and 1965, employing exactly the same construction and components as the original units, are guaranteed to provide a faithful reproduction of the unique tonal nuances of the iconic Red Special with plenty of BM-approved \"bite, growl, and volume\".",
            "Electronics": "The Super's wiring scheme, switches, potentiometer and capacitor values are exactly the same as the original's with the switching system correctly mounted to an aluminium mounting plate and reproduction, lathe-turned, aluminium control knobs. Additional Greg Fryer-approved enhancements include shielding under the entire scratch plate surface area to reduce finger static noise and to assist in insulation from electrical and RF interference and a reinforcing plate inlaid into the guitar's body at the output jack to prevent accidental splitting damage.",
            "Hardware": "Developed by Kazutaka Ijuin, the knife-edge tremolo tailpiece is a drop-dead accurate, hand-crafted reproduction of Brian's original design with the trem arm shaped to the exact curves of the Red Special's, from brass templates made by Greg Fryer in 1998. In conjunction with a modified Wilkinson roller bridge and Graph Tech Black TUSQ-XL nut, the tremolo system performs, as you'd expect, with astonishing comfort, control and dexterity with perfect return to pitch, aided by the inclusion of Gotoh's fantastic Magnum Lock® machineheads, finished with white pearl buttons, of course.",
            "Extras": "The BMG Super is supplied with an exclusive, premium quality BMG branded fitted hard case by Hiscox and an accompanying certificate of authentication, numbered and personally signed by Dr. Brian May.",

The guitar arrived here in impeccable conditions and was also discreetly tuned despite the air travel. It's a faithful replica of Brian May's and I'm having so much fun with the huge neck, the roller bridge and the switch combinations of the pickups... What can I say, my guitar for life! Absolutely recommended - if you can, try it and get one."

Not a fan of Volume/Volume but a Master Volume and Blend Control. Actually I think the wiring is out of phase. As soon as I backed off of the neck pickup, the audio disappeared.\n2. The Neck pickup should have been full range, it almost is a Mudbucker. I was happy they used Hipshot Lite Tuners but they should have used their bridge as well."

In other words, when holding the bass and looking down at the knobs, they are tilted, higher on one side than the other; not flat with an even amount of space between the underside of the knobs and the top of the guitar. When you look from the front you don't notice it, but I rarely look from the front as I am playing it. Are they just press fit knobs that I can reseat? I've never seen this before and I own 26 basses. Other than that, the bass is very nice"

When I opened the box it was a good surprise, as beautiful as my BMG Special. The knobs look better! No trouble with the weight! The scale is good and playing with pick-up knobs can give you a good sound between the hell of the humbucker and the sharpness of the single. The width of the neck is quite huge but doesn't give me any trouble. Mine had been shipped without flatwound strings, I changed the roundwound for flats and it's really better, smoother. The electronics are also good quality - no noise, no scratches. Plugged in my fuzz, I can have a bigger feedback on my amp than my guitarist. I really enjoy this bass... if you're thinking about something different in shape with an amazing groove, buy it. Greetings from Limoges, France !"

If I'm being honest, coming from playing a Fender Jazz, with its 38mm neck, if the BMG bass had a tad narrower neck (45mm is a bit wide) to me, it would be the perfect bass. As said, just a personal preference. It's the only thing to me that lets it down. Love it otherwise!"

        "short-desc": "Inspired by Arielle's own BM-influenced 'Two-Tone' guitar and designed from the ground up by the two musicians",
        "story": "Dr. Brian May and Brian May Guitars are delighted to present a brand new addition to the BMG line for 2021, the result of a fresh collaboration with American singer, songwriter and guitarist Arielle and the first original build that the Queen virtuoso has actively contributed to since he and his father embarked on the construction of the Red Special almost 60 years ago. Inspired by Arielle's own BM-influenced 'Two-Tone' guitar and designed from the ground up by the two musicians as a competitively priced counterpart to the best-selling BMG Special, this exceptional instrument has been brought to vivid life by the House Music team to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their successful ongoing partnership with Brian May. The new model takes its cue from Arielle's affection for classic 20th century guitar design, rocking a sleek, retro-futuristic look, striking burnt orange and translucent blue livery, distinctive raised centre-strip, vintage two-piece pickguard, chrome hardware and contrasting switch plate, alongside choice elements from Dr. May's storied, homespun creation - the distinctive 3-a-side headstock, familiar 24\" scale, a trio of series wound, Tri-Sonic style pickups, and his famous phase switching system. The result is an instant modern classic. \"The Red Special in a parallel universe\", as the maestro proudly proclaims, takes Arielle's novel design to a whole new level and, of course, infused with a liberal dose of RS DNA, delivers everything one should rightfully expect from a Brian May Guitar - impeccable design, superior quality, pro-spec construction, exceptional playability, and devastating tonal dexterity.",
        "details": {
            "Striking Body Design": "The flamboyant, asymmetric angles of the Arielle's lightweight body, at once timeless and forward thinking, clearly pay homage to radical American automotive and electric guitar designs of the 1950s and '60s, with a distinctive raised centre strip increasing the body mass for enhanced sustain and resonance and a split, 3-ply parchment pickguard and eye-catching, two-tone diagonal finish completing the cool, vintage look. The solid body is constructed from Limba (aka 'Korina' by which it is more commonly known within the US luthier community). In keeping with Arielle and Dr. May's keen interest in utilizing sustainable sources, the use of this attractive African tonewood recognizes the importance and success of worldwide conservation programs; although considered severely threatened by over-exploitation in the first half of the last century, concerted efforts to preserve the species have seen Limba flourish well beyond its natural rainforest habitat, making its way into savannah areas and even penetrating regional evergreen forests.",
            "24\" Scale Mahogany Neck": "Employing the short 2\" scale favoured by Brian on the original Red Special, the one piece mahogany neck, in perfect balance with the lightweight body, has been engineered with a decidedly contemporary feel, featuring a generous 45mm nut width, comfortably spacious profile, and wonderfully smooth 24 fret ebony fingerboard with Arielle's choice of abalone diamond snowflake inlays in the traditional BM pattern.",
            "Tri-Sonic Style Pickups": "Like the best-selling Special, the BMG Arielle features three BM branded Tri-Sonic style single coil pickups, modern replicas of the vintage '60s units so fundamental to the Red Special's powerful and distinctive sonic character with the same series wiring, retro-styling and magnet alignment as the originals.",
            "BM Switching System": "The famous Brian May design switch system is provided by electronics specialists Switchcraft. Six black DPDT switches, featuring high quality contacts and mounted on a contrasting 3-ply black control plate, engage each pickup individually as well as providing dedicated phase reversal, a familiar configuration that gives the BMG Arielle the same astonishing tonal dexterity as the original Red Special itself. Volume and tone are controlled by 250k pots with a Sprague 0.033μF 'Orange Drop' film capacitor delivering exceptional sonic purity, a nuanced tonal roll-off sweep and, with individual pickups or selected pairings, a pleasingly warm response, without getting too muddy or bright.",
            "Wilkinson WVP Tremolo Bridge": "Continuing BMG's long association with veteran British engineer Trevor Wilkinson, the Arielle is fitted with his acclaimed WVP 2-point tremolo, a vintage-flavored variant of the unit used on the BMG Special. With a modern, friction-free design offering one of the smoothest actions of any fulcrum vibrato currently available coupled with a sleek, low-profile surround to eliminate lateral saddle movement, the WVP offers superior comfort, stability and performance.dditional features include a stamped steel, heat hardened top plate, solid stainless steel saddles, and a \"stagger-drilled\" solid steel sustain block that provides unrivalled tuning stability, ensures easy and accurate intonation adjustment and improves overall sustain, brightness and top end, resulting in a more expansive, sharper tone.",
            "Grover Tuners": "he distinctive BM style headstock sports Grover 406 Mini-Locking Rotomatic® tuners, making re-stringing a breeze and ensuring rock-solid tuning stability, even with lots of vibrato and string bends. These superb, machine heads feature compact metal knobs with adjustable tension, an 18:1 gear ratio for fine tuning, lifetime sealed lubrication and Grover's ingenious internal \"Locking Cam\" string post that automatically secure the strings as they are brought to pitch.",

Its long fretboard oozes a sense of confidence and being to the player, while the Tri-Sonic pickups are sharp, bright and distinctive with their series and in/out of phase controls - the characteristic sound of BMG - as good as ever. The volume, tone and whammy are close to the strumming hand and very accessible. The bridge is also perfectly placed as a rest for picking. This is a stylistically delightful guitar and, in its Burnt Orange and Translucent Blue, a joy to own."
